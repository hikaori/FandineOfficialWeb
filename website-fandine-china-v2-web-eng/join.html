            Automatic Reload of the amount that was transferred into the Wallet. The User may change the User’s payment
            preferences at any time. If the User wishes to discontinue the Automatic Reload feature, the User must

            <br>6.4 Account Balance and Expiration. The User may check the balance of the Wallet on the User’s Account.
            The Monetary Unit transferred into the Wallet will not expire during the term of the Agreement.
            <br>6.5 Receipt. The User may request a receipt from the Establishment at the point-of-sale when the User
            purchases a Product from the Establishment using the Wallet. The receipt will indicate that the User used
            funds from the Wallet to make the purchase.
            <br>6.6 Liability. The User is responsible for any and all transactions associated with the User’s Wallet.
            If the User becomes aware that unauthorized use of the User’s account is being made, the User must contact
            FanDine immediately. Upon notification from the User that unauthorized use of the User’s account is being
            made, FanDine will attempt to freeze the User’s account to prevent ongoing use of the User’s account.
            FanDine reserves the right to limit or terminate the User’s use of the Services if FanDine reasonably
            believes that the use is unauthorized, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful.
            <br>6.7 Bill Errors and Corrections. FanDine may correct the balance of the User’s Wallet if FanDine
            believes that a clerical, billing or accounting error has occurred. The User should contact FanDine directly
            if the User has any questions regarding the User’s transaction history or any correction that has been made.
            <br>6.8 Disclaimer. FanDine does not represent or warrant that any or every Establishment will accept
            payment for the Products from the User’s Wallet. The User must contact the Establishment directly to confirm
            that the Establishment will accept payment on the Services.
            <br>6.9 Transfers. The User may transfer as a gift the Monetary Units held by the User in the Wallet to any
            other User on the Services at a rate of 1 Monetary Unit for 1 Monetary Unit transferred. Upon instructions
            from an authorized representative, FanDine may transfer as a gift the Monetary Units held by the User in the
            Wallet to another User of the Services.
            <br>6.10 Conversions
            <br>6.10.1 Conversion of Restaurant Credits. The User may convert Restaurant Credits into the Monetary Unit
            on the Services at the following fixed exchange rate (the “Transfer Exchange Rate”):
            <br>Purchase rate by FanDine: 1 Restaurant Credit = 0.9 Monetary Units
            <br>Sell rate by User to another User: 1 Restaurant Credit = 0.8 Monetary Units
            <br>The User may sell any Restaurant Credits held by the User to any other User on the Services in exchange
            for Monetary Units at the Transfer Exchange Rate.
            <br>6.10.2 Conversion of the Monetary Unit. All amounts loaded into the Wallet are held and denominated in
            the currency of the country in which the Services are being used, as specified by the User upon creation of
            the Account. When the User makes a purchase at an Establishment in a different country using the Services,
            the total amount is converted from the currency of that country into the currency of the Monetary Unit and
            deducted from the Wallet. The actual balance in the Wallet following the conversion will be in the Monetary
            Unit. Currency conversions are based on currency exchange rates applicable on the date of the transaction.
            <br><br><b>7. Restaurant Credits Rewards Program</b>
            <br>7.1 Redemption. The User will be able to participate in the Restaurant Credits rewards program that
            rewards the User with Restaurant Credits that can be redeemed to pay the charges by the Establishment (the
            “Bill”) for the Products provided by the Establishment. Restaurant Credits can only be redeemed at and by
            the Establishment up to value in Restaurant Credits awarded by the Establishment pursuant to the
            Establishment Terms to the User and during the specific hours of business operation allocated for redemption
            by the Establishment (“Redemption Period”). Other restrictions may apply to the redemption of the Restaurant
            Credits. The User must contact the Establishment directly and before dining to determine the Redemption
            Period that applies to that Establishment and whether any other restrictions apply. Restaurant Credits may
            be redeemed every day that the Establishment is open for business to the public and during the Redemption
            Period established by the Establishment.
            <br>7.2 Restaurant Credits. Restaurant Credits is a loyalty reward program operated by FanDine. The
            accumulation of Restaurant Credits does not entitle the User to any vested rights and, in accumulating
            Restaurant Credits, the Users may not rely upon the continued availability of any award, reward,
            award/reward level, premium, privilege or other benefit.
            <br>Restaurant Credits have no monetary value whatsoever and cannot under any circumstances form the basis
            of a monetary claim against FanDine. Restaurant Credits are not replaceable or redeemable for cash, other
            than as provided in the Terms. The User may transfer as a gift any Restaurant Credits held by the User to
            any other User on the Services at a rate of 1 Restaurant Credit for 1 Restaurant Credit transferred.

            <br>(b) FanDine Termination. If FanDine suspends or terminates the User’s Account, any Restaurant Credits in
            the User’s Account and Monetary Units in the Wallet prior to suspension or termination of the User’s Account
            may become inaccessible to the User indefinitely upon suspension or termination of the User’s Account.
            <br>(c) Establishment Termination. If an Establishment’s Account on the Services is suspended or terminated,
            however caused, the User may be eligible to have the value of the Restaurant Credits that remain outstanding
            by the User for that Establishment at the time of the termination converted into the Monetary Unit at the
            following fixed exchange rate (the “Termination Exchange Rate”):
            <br>1 Restaurant Credit = 0.8 Monetary Units
            <br>The User may be eligible to have the value of the Restaurant Credits that remain outstanding by the User
            converted into the Monetary Unit only for the value of the Restaurant Credits that Establishment has issued
            to the User.
            <br>FanDine will convert the User’s outstanding Restaurant Credits into the Monetary Unit at the Termination
            Exchange Rate only if FanDine receives the outstanding balance of Restaurant Credits in the Monetary Unit
            from the Establishment at which the Restaurant Credits are redeemable (the “Funds”), pursuant to the
            Establishment Terms, after the termination of the Establishment from the Services. If the Establishment does
            not pay the Funds to FanDine, the Restaurant Credits outstanding by the User for the Establishment will not
            be converted into the Monetary Unit and there will be no payment to the User pursuant to the termination of
            the Establishment from the Services.
            <br>If an Establishment’s Account is terminated because the Establishment ceases to operate or do business,
            all Restaurant Credits that remain outstanding and redeemable by the User for that Establishment will be
            forfeited and cancelled.
            <br>16.5 Recourse by User. If the User is dissatisfied with the Services, Site or the Terms, the User’s sole
            and exclusive remedy is to discontinue the use of the Services and Site. In such an event, the User agrees
            to destroy and cease all use of all materials and intellectual property rights of FanDine obtained by the
            User from the Services and Site and all copies thereof.
            <br>16.6 Survival. These provisions shall survive the termination of the Terms, however caused.
            <br><br><b>17. Force Majeure</b>
            <br>17.1 Neither party will be liable to the other for the failure to fulfill obligations caused by
            circumstances outside of its reasonable control. This clause does not apply to any of the User’s obligations
            to pay charges for services provided.
            <br><br><b>18. Copyright Infringement Notices Under The Copyright Act</b>
            <br>18.1 FanDine respects the intellectual property rights of others and require those that use the Services
            to do the same. FanDine may, in appropriate circumstances and at FanDine’s discretion, remove or disable

            FanDine’s discretion, remove or disable links or references to an online location that contains infringing
            or unlawful material or activity.
            <br>18.2 Effective January 1, 2015, the Canadian Copyright Act provides that an owner of the copyright in a
            work or other subject-matter may send a notice of claimed infringement to a person who provides the means of
            telecommunication through which the electronic location that is the subject of the claim of infringement is
            connected to the Internet or another digital network.
            <br>18.3 If the User believes that the User’s copyright has been or is being infringed upon by material
            found in the Services, the User is required to follow the following procedure to file a notification in
            writing pursuant to section 41.25(2) of the Copyright Act:
            <br>(a) state the User’s name and address and any other particulars prescribed by regulation that enable
            communication with the User;
            <br>(b) identify the work or other subject-matter to which the claimed infringement relates;
            <br>(c) state the User’s interest or right with respect to the copyright in the work or other
            subject-matter;
            <br>(d) specify the location data for the electronic location to which the claimed infringement relates;
            <br>(e) specify the infringement that is claimed;
            <br>(f) specify the date and time of the commission of the claimed infringement; and
            <br>(g) any other relevant information.
            <br>18.4 Upon receipt of the above written notification, FanDine shall:
            <br>(a) as soon as feasible forward the notice electronically to the person to whom the electronic location
            identified by the location data specified in the notice belongs and inform the User of its forwarding or, if
            applicable, of the reason why it was not possible to forward it; and
            <br>(b) retain records that will allow the identity of the person to whom the electronic location belongs to
            be determined, and do so for six months beginning on the day on which the notice of claimed infringement is
            received or, if the User commences proceedings relating to the claimed infringement and so notifies the
            person before the end of those six months, for one year after the day on which the person receives the
            notice of claimed infringement.
            <br>18.5 Note that not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted materials are infringements. The doctrine of
            fair dealing under the Copyright Act may be applicable. FanDine cannot offer any legal advice. Should the
            User have questions, the User must seek legal advice from a lawyer.
